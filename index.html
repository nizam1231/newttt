    <p class="paragraph-400">
	
        The project owner needed an idea to support the private artisan sector, especially in furniture. He desired a qualitative leap that was unlike any before; he wanted distinction and uniqueness. He needed a project that would launch from the city of Tripoli, Lebanon, to the entire world. He wanted to show the world the beauty and creativity of a city whose artisanal works have flourished and continue to flourish with ingenuity to this day.
    </p>
    
    <p class="paragraph-400">
	
        Then, he began the preparations...
        
        He started working on eight sheets of paper, embarking on the journey of a million steps with his modest progress, step by step.
        
        <b><q>I wanted the furniture design to reflect the city's cultural and historical heritage, incorporating Scandinavian touches and techniques. I began drawing and learning on seven A4 sheets, and the eighth is what you see now.</q></b>
        
        So this is where the idea began. A piece of furniture was designed to be the start of the TLB project. To make it unique and different, and to reach a wider audience, the project owner decided to incorporate NFTs into this work. The design was published on the "OpenSea" platform with the seven documents under the name TheFirst Design.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>- TLBToken</h3>
    <p class="paragraph-600">
        To develop the project on a broader scale, work is being done on TLBToken for people interested in investing in TLB.
        
        This Token was specifically created to develop and support the TLB project. We worked on TLBToken to serve as an announcement for our project.
        
        We have not yet listed or included it, as we are currently working on the distribution as follows:
        
        We have developed a set of NFTs under the name "Airdrop TLB token" with various prices starting from $5.
        
        Each buyer of this collection will receive 1000 tokens.
        
        The first distribution will consist of 1,500,000 tokens.
        
        <b><q>I will distribute all the tokens to make them more reliable for investors. This will be done in phases, and I may burn some tokens.</q>


</b>
        We are currently working on a development plan for this project, which includes integrating it into the retail market where you will be able to use TLBToken to purchase what we produce at TLB.
        
        So if you wish to invest in this token, don't hesitate to buy "Airdrop TLB token" to receive 1000 tokens. The maximum per wallet is 3000 tokens.
        
        On the Polygon network
        TOKEN CONTRACT :
        MAX_SUPPLY = 50000000
        MAX_WALLET_AMOUNT = 3000
        CONTRACT: <small>0xD993751fBfC9A02249b839f3f3FB0E0188097DfB</small><br>
